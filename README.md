# FEBODTOOL: An Interface Tool for Finite Element–based Optimal Design 
This program introduces a computational interface tool between ABAQUS® and MATLAB® that can be used for carrying out the parametric optimal design of complex mechanical components. The software is developed entirely in MATLAB® environment which can solve the constrained optimization problems without the existence of the explicit constraint function. In this software, the design variables are proposed for selection through a user-friendly environment and the objective function can be iteratively evaluated by the finite-element analysis in ABAQUS®. The finite-element model is modified and updated according to the post-processing results in the ABAQUS® environment. The optimizing tool can cover metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm in MATLAB®.The capability of the proposed tool is illustrated by investigating the optimal design two case studies.
